        <h1>Fretboard panels overview</h1>

        <p>
        Frettly was designed not to simply show a single fretboard with a scale, which would
        reset next time the application was started, but as a macOS document based application
        capable of displaying <b><em>many</em></b> fretboards at a time, collected within each
        document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember - all fretboards within the same document are for that documents current 
            instrument/tuning/handedness configuration</li>
          <li>When fretboards are added to the document, they are appended to the bottom of the document.
        Click and drag a fretboard, and drop it before or after any other fretboard to re-order your
        fretboards.</li>
          <li>Zoom the fretboards within a document with standard macOS ⌘+ and ⌘- key combos</li>
          <li>If a fretboards frets are off screen, scroll the fretboard with trackpad or mouse</li>
          <li>To edit the type/root/pattern of a fret board, click the pencil icon at the top 
            right of the fretboard to open its edit dialog.</li>
          <li>The edit dialog (pencil icon again!) also allows you to delete a fretboard from the document</li>
          <li>The icon to the left of that same pencil toggles the fretboards displaying of either notes or intervals</li>
          <li>The coloured buttons centered above each fretboard serve several purposes
            <ul>
              <li>Display the colour coded note and its interval within the scale/mode/chord</li>
              <li>Hover over one of those buttons and the occurrences on the fretboard are highlighted</li>
              <li>Click one of those buttons, and that note/interval will be removed from the fretboard (you can click again to bring it back!)</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
