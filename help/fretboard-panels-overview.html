        <h1>Fretboard panels overview</h1>
        <p>
          Frettly is designed as a macOS document-based application. Rather than showing a single fretboard that resets the next time the app is opened,
          Frettly lets you collect <strong><em>many</em></strong> fretboards within each document.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Remember: all fretboards within the same document use that document’s current instrument, tuning, and handedness.
          </li>
          <li>
            New fretboards are added to the bottom of the document. You can reorder them by dragging and dropping a fretboard before or after another,
            or by using the document’s “Arrange panels” dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zoom fretboards within a document using the standard macOS ⌘+ and ⌘- shortcuts.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a fretboard extends off-screen horizontally, scroll it left and right with your trackpad or mouse to bring hidden sections into view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking anywhere within a fretboard makes it the currently focused fretboard for navigation. The Up and Down arrow keys move focus
            while bringing the newly focused panel into view.
          </li>
        </ul>


          <ul class="list">
            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard configuration</h2>
              To edit the type, root, or pattern of a fretboard, click the configuration icon to the right of the panel title to open its edit dialog.

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Scale chords derivation</h2>
              For fretboards with a content type of <strong>Scale</strong>, the button to the right of the configuration icon opens a dialog showing
              the diatonic chords in that key.

              <figure class="gallery-figure">
                <img

            <p></p>
              <p>
                For each diatonic chord, the triad notes are shown. Each chord can be previewed (using “Pattern play”), added individually to the document,
                or added as part of a single “Add all” action.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard note/interval chips</h2>
              The notes in each fretboard’s scale, mode, or chord are shown as chips at the top of the panel:

              <figure class="gallery-figure">
                <img
                  src="/images/help-chips.png"

              </figure>
            <p></p>

              <p>
                Each chip shows a note and its interval within the pattern, using the following notations:
              </p>

              <ul class="multi-col-list">
                <li>P1 — Perfect unison (root)</li>

                <li>P8 — Perfect octave</li>
                <li>m9 — Minor ninth</li>
                <li>M9 — Major ninth</li>
                <li>m10 — Minor tenth</li>
                <li>M10 — Major tenth</li>
                <li>P11 — Perfect eleventh</li>
                <li>A11 — Augmented eleventh</li>
                <li>P12 — Perfect twelfth</li>

                <li>M13 — Major thirteenth</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Hovering over a chip highlights that note or interval across the fretboard:
              </p>

            <p></p>
              <p>
                Clicking a chip toggles that note or interval between visible and hidden across the fretboard:
              </p>

              <figure class="gallery-figure">

            <p></p>
              <p>
                Note: hidden notes are not played when using “Pattern play”.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard controls - marking</h2>
              To the right of the chips is a bank of additional fretboard controls. The first group of three buttons relates to marking notes.

              <figure class="gallery-figure">
                <img
                  src="/images/help-fretboard-top-right.png"
                  alt="Fretboard controls (top right)"
                  class="gallery-image size-s"
                  loading="lazy"
                />
                <figcaption class="meta">
                  Fretboard controls (top right)
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

            <p></p>
              <p>
                Each note on a fretboard can be marked. Marked notes display a dashed circle around the note.
                Marking mode is enabled by clicking the first button (the marker pen). When enabled, it turns yellow.
                Once notes are marked, the button also shows the count of marked notes on that fretboard (some may be off-screen).
                While marking mode is enabled, clicking a note marks it — the usual play modes do not operate until marking mode is disabled. Once notes are marked, click the marker pen button again, and you are returned to standard fretboard mode, where the document's play mode will determine how the note(s) are played when clicked, and marked notes remain on screen alongside unmarked notes.
              </p>

              <figure class="gallery-figure">
                <img
                  src="/images/help-marking.png"
                  alt="Marking notes on a fretboard"
                  class="gallery-image size-s"

              </figure>

            <p></p>
              <p>
                The other buttons in the marking group remain disabled until at least one note is marked.
                The second button clears all marks, and uses a two-step confirmation: the first click arms the action (the button turns red),
                and the second click — while armed and within five seconds — performs the clear. Otherwise, it returns to an unarmed state.
              </p>

              <p>
                The third button is “View marked notes”. It is also disabled until there are marked notes.
                You may prefer to rely on the dashed outline alone to spot marked notes, or you can use “View marked notes” to hide unmarked notes.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard controls - notepad</h2>
              The fourth button is the notepad control. A new fretboard starts with an empty notepad, so the button appears plain.
              Clicking it toggles the notepad’s visibility. Once the notepad contains text, the button turns yellow to remind you that notes are present.
              Notepads are saved with their fretboards in the Frettly document.

            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard controls - labelling mode</h2>
              The fifth button toggles between viewing notes and viewing intervals.
              By default, fretboards show note labels, and the tooltip shows the corresponding interval.
              When you switch to interval labels, the tooltip text changes accordingly.

              <figure class="gallery-figure">

            <p></p>
            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard controls - delete fretboard</h2>
              The sixth button is the delete control. Like “Clear marks”, it uses a two-step confirmation:
              the first click arms it, and the second click within five seconds deletes the fretboard, its notepad, and all marks.
            </li>

            <li>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Fretboard controls - duplicate fretboard</h2>
              The seventh button duplicates the current fretboard, inserting the copy below the original.
              Only the fretboard’s type, root, and pattern are duplicated — notepad text and marks are not.
            </li>
