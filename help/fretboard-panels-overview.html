        <h1>Fretboard panels overview</h1>

        <p>
        Frettly was designed not to simply show a single fretboard with a scale, which would
        reset next time the application was started, but as a macOS document based application
        capable of displaying <b><em>many</em></b> fretboards at a time, collected within each
        document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember - all fretboards within the same document are for that documents current 
            instrument/tuning/handedness configuration</li>
          <li>When fretboards are added to the document, they are appended to the bottom of the document.
        Click and drag a fretboard, and drop it before or after any other fretboard to re-order your
        fretboards.</li>
          <li>Zoom the fretboard's within a document with standard macOS ⌘+ and ⌘- key combos</li>
          <li>If a fretboard's frets are off screen, scroll the fretboard with trackpad or mouse</li>
        </ul>
