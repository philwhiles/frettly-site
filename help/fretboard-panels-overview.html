        <h1>Fretboard panels overview</h1>

        <p>
        Frettly was designed not to simply show a single fretboard with a scale, which would
        reset next time the application was started, but as a macOS document based application
        capable of displaying <b><em>many</em></b> fretboards at a time, collected within each
        document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember - all fretboards within the same document are for that documents
            current instrument/tuning/handedness configuration.
          </li>
          <li>When fretboards are added to the document, they are appended to the bottom 
            of the document.  Click and drag a fretboard, and drop it before or after any
            other fretboard to re-order your fretboards, or use the documents
            'Arrange panels' button.</li>
          <li>Zoom the fretboard's within a document with standard macOS ⌘+ and ⌘- key combos.</li>
          <li>If a fretboard's frets are off-screen, scroll the fretboard left to right with trackpad or mouse to bring off screen sections into view.</li>

          <li>
            Fretboard panels can be clicked with hold to drag and drop them into the order you desire, or use the documents 'Arrange panels' button, top right.

          </li>

          <li>Clicking anywhere within a fretboard makes it the currently focussed fretboard
            for navigational purposes, and the up and down arrow keys will move that focus while bringing the newly focussed panel into view.
        </ul>

              For fretboards of type Scale, to the right of the fretboard config button is 
              the three note 'Show diatonic chords' button. This opens a dialog showing the
              chords within that scale.

        played (Pattern play mode), added individually to the document, or all added together.
            </li>

            <li>The notes comprising each fretboard's scale, mode or chord note sequence are shown centre top of each fretboard:

Hovering over a chip highlights the note/interval's occurrences across the fretboard:

Clicking a chip will 
toggle between hiding and showing it across the fretboard.

        Note: hidden notes will not be played when using 'Pattern play' mode
            </li>

            <li>
              To the right of the note/interval chips is a bank of more fretboard controls.
              The first group of three buttons all relate to 'marking' of notes.

         <figure class="gallery-figure">
          <img
            src="/images/help-fretboard-top-right.png"
            alt="Fretboard controls top right"
            class="gallery-image size-s"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption class="meta">
          Fretboard control top right
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
              Each note
              on a fretboard can be marked, and when marked, display a dashed circle around
              the note. Marking mode is enabled by clicking the first of those three buttons displaying a marker pen. When enabled it will turn yellow, and once notes are marked it will show the number of marked notes on that fretboard (some may be off screen). When marking mode is enabled, clicking a note marks it, so none of the usual play modes will function until marking is disabled.

         <figure class="gallery-figure">
          <img
            src="/images/help-marking.png"
            alt="Marking notes on a fretboard"
            class="gallery-image size-s"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption class="meta">
          Marking notes on a fretboard
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        Notice that the other three buttons in the 'Marking' group will be disabled until
        at least one note in the fretboard is marked. The second button wipes all marks
        off the fretboard, and requires clicking twice. The first time it is clicked, it
        will go red to indicate it is 'armed'. If you click it a second time while armed and
        within five seconds, it will immediately perform the wipe, else revert to unarmed.
        <p/>
        <p>
        The final button in the group is the 'View marked notes'. Again disabled until there
        are marked notes. Once notes are marked they
        gain the dashed outline to indicate their marked state. You may prefer to rely on 
        that visual clue alone in order to call out notes, or you may prefer to use the
        'View marked notes' button to view only the marked notes without the dashed outline
        and hide unmarked notes.
        <p/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The fourth button in the fretboard controls is the notepad button. A new fretboard
          will have no notepad content initially, so the button will be plain. When clicked,
          the fretboards notepad will alternately be shown/hidden, and once the notepad has
          text within it, the notepad button will be shown in yellow to remind you of the
          presence of the text. The notepads are saved with the fretboards in the Frettly
          document.
         <figure class="gallery-figure">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </li>

        <li>
          The fifth button is the View Notes/View Intervals button. By default each fretboard
          will show the occurrence of all the notes across the fretboard, and the tooltip for each will tell you the corresponding interval. Click the fifth button to alternate between the fretboard labels showing notes or the intervals they represent, and the tooltip text flips accordingly.
         <figure class="gallery-figure">

        </figure>
        </li>
        <p/>

        <li>
          The sixth button is the 'Delete fretboard' control, and like the 'Wipe marks'
          button, the first click primes it, and the second click within fice seconds
          triggers the deletion of the fretboard, it's notepad and all it's marks.
        </li>

        <li>
          The final, seventh button is the 'Duplicate fretboard' control, which when
          pressed, will as you would expect copy and paste the current fretboard below itself. Only the type/root/pattern nature of the fretboard is duplicated - neither notepad or marks are duplicated.
        </li>
          </ul>
