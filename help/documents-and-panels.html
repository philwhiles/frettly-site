        <p>
          Every Frettly document is built from one or more panels. Each panel shows
          a specific scale, chord or mode for the document’s chosen instrument and
          tuning.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can think of a document as a notebook for a particular idea or
          project. Within that notebook, panels let you lay out different shapes,
          positions and concepts on the fretboard so they can be seen together.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Create new panels for scales, chords or modes.</li>
          <li>Scroll up and down through panels in a single document.</li>
          <li>Reorder panels by dragging them into a new position.</li>
          <li>Save different documents for different learnings or projects.</li>
        </ul>
