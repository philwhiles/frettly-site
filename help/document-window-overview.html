        <h1>Document window overview</h1>

        <p>
          Frettly was designed to utilise the macOS Document model - just like Pages etc.
          Rather than show one fretboard which has to be initialised on opening the application ie not
          persisted, Frettly creates Documents into which you place your chosen fretboards.
          The document files are your notebooks for learning, projects and discovery, where you can
          collect say those blues scales you wanted to learn, the minor chords you wanted to practise etc.
          Because Frettly uses documents, remember that those documents can be moved, duplicated, shared and
          even reverted with Time Machine (and they render in the Time Machine view of your history)
        </p>

        <p>
          If you create two documents, one for guitar the other bass, you can flit from one to the other and
          Frettly will play the corresponding when you click on its notes.
          Don't forget to explore the macOS menu bar's <em>File</em> option.
        </p>

        <p>
          The image below shows a document with two fretboards, and the document level controls highlighted.
          From left to right those highlighted controls are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Edit document settings - change the entire documents instrument/tuning/handedness</li>
          <li>Jump to - with a document containing many fretboards, this allows you to quickly jump to any of those fretboards rather than scrolling up and down hunting for it</li>
          <li>Toggle the note audio - between single note play and sustained play. In single play mode, click a note
          and you will hear the note played on the instrument, and as soon as the mouse is released the audio will cutout (Hint, click and HOLD the mouse).
          In sustained mode, each note clicked will play for a few seconds before fading, and multiple notes can be played in quick succession to get a feel
          for the combination of those notes when played together</li>
          <li>Add fretboard - add as many as you like to a document!</li>
        </ul>
