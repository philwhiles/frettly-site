        <h1>Document window overview</h1>

        <p>
          Frettly was designed to utilise the macOS Document model - just like Pages etc.
          Rather than show one fretboard which has to be initialised on opening the application ie not
          persisted, Frettly creates Documents into which you place your chosen fretboards.
          The document files are your notebooks for learning, projects and discovery, where you can
          collect say those blues scales you wanted to learn, the minor chords you wanted to practise etc.
          Because Frettly uses documents, those documents can be moved, duplicated, shared and
          even reverted with Time Machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you create two documents, one for guitar the other bass, you can flit from one to the other and
          Frettly will play the notes using each documents configure instrument.
          Don't forget to explore the macOS menu bar's <em>File</em> option.
        </p>


        <p>The controls in the top right of a documents window, control Frettlys behaviour
        and display within that document only, while fretboard controls are displayed per fretboard.

          From left to right those highlighted controls are:
        </p>

        <h2>Play mode</h2>
        <p>
        Frettly has three different ways of playing the notes you click within fretboards:
        <ul>
          <li>
          Sustained play - each note clicked will play for a few seconds before fading, and multiple notes can be played in quick succession to get a feel
          for the combination of those notes when played together, allowing you to hear a combination of intervals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single play - click and hold a note to hear it play and on release of that click
            the note will be cut off. Single play mode allows you to train your ear to that note/interval alone,
            without the distraction of other notes ringing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pattern play - when you click on the root note of a pattern, Frettly will play each of the 
            notes in the fretboards pattern running down the string. If the pattern is a scale 
            you will hear seven notes (assuming you have not hidden any - see Fretboard help for
            hiding notes). If the pattern is a chord, Frettly will play the notes in the chord in sequence (again assuming none have been hidden)
            and will end that sequence with a strum of all the notes. The strum is not meant to sound like any specific chord fingering, as each note
            is only played once, and all will be in the same octave as the first clicked note.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Jump to current fretboard</h2>
        <p>
        When you click anywhere within a fretboard, it becomes the currently focussed one. Up and down arrow keys will
        move that focus up and down a fretboard at a time. The fact that one is focussed is nothing more than a
        navigational aid, as all controls (even notes) across all fretboards are usable, regardless of the focus.
        But that focus may help you when building a document containing many fretboards, as you may want to set the
        focus on a fretboard, the primary scale for instance, and be able to return to it from anywhere in the 
        document.
