        <p>
          When you first create a new document in Frettly, you’ll be asked to select an 
          instrument type, its tuning, and whether you are left-handed.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Select an instrument from Guitar, Bass, Banjo, Mandolin or Ukulele</li>
          <li>Select a tuning for that instrument - Frettly comes with multiple instrument specific tunings.
          Note that in the free version of Frettly the choice of tuning is limited to the standard tuning for the selected
          instrument.</li>
          <li>By default all fretboards will be for right handed players with the nut end of the fretboard on the far
            left - select 'Left handed' in the documents settings and all it's fretboards will be displayed with the
            nut end of the fretboard on the far right
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The instrument/tuning/handedness selections made when the document is created will determine 
          the appearance and layout of all fretboards created within it, and will be re-applied when
          the document is reloaded. The selections made are summarised at the head of the document window.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT - any of those choices made be changed later, using the pencil icon next to that summary at
          the top of the document, and when those changes are applied, ALL fretboards within the document 
          will be reset and shown appropriately. ie start a document with Guitar, standard tuning, right handed,
          and later change your mind and edit the document to be a left handed bass guitar with Drop D tuning, and voila,
          all the fretboards will adjust to the new document settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have made that selection and clicked 'Apply',
          you will be presented with your new but still empty document. Click the 'Add fretboard' button on the top right
          of the document window and you will be presented with the create fretboard dialog.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Select your fretboards 'Content type' from Scale, Mode or Chord</li>
          <li>Select the root note (P1) for the chosen content type</li>
          <li>Select the pattern to be used for this fretboard. Note that in the free version of Frettly 
            the choice of patterns is limited
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once your fretboard is created, you can create another, and another, and..
          All the fretboards you create will be stored in the current document, open that document
          tomorrow, and all your fretboards will be there waiting for you.
