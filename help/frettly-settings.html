        <p>
          While each fretboard has controls within it which determine the characteristics of just that fretboard, and each document has document wide 
          configuration (instrument, tuning and handedness) which apply to all of the fretboards within it, Frettly has application wide settings, found in 
          menubar item “Frettly” -> “Settings”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settings are divided into tabs:
          <ul>
          <li>
            General - Miscellaneous settings
          </li>
          <li>
            Documents - Settings which affect document level functionality
          </li>
          <li>
            Fretboards - Settings which affect fretboard level functionality
          </li>
          <li>
            Support - Help related
          </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <ul class="list">

              On first installation, Frettly presents an introductory welcome page, offering to create a new document, open an existing one, or open
              the inbuilt example document. That welcome page can be set to not re-appear on future application launch, but should you wish to have
              it re-appear, the option is here.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
              When documents are first created, in the new document dialog prompting for instrument, tuning and handedness, the latter initially defaults
              to right-handed, favouring the majority of players. If you are in the minority, set the default to be left-handed here.
                </li>
                <li>
              The play mode when clicking fretboard notes has three settings, sustained, single or pattern run. The default mode for
              new documents can be set in this tab. The play mode can be changed within the document at any time once it has at least 
              one fretboard.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Background - choose here which wood graphic you would like for all fretboards in all documents. The choice you make is seen
                  immediately in any open documents, so you can see the effect straight away if you have open documents, but a preview is also shown 
                  in the dialog.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Note colours - depending on the background you choose, you may like to choose darker/lighter or subdued/vibrant colours for the notes
                  and intervals shown in fretboards. Again, your selection is instantly applied to open documents and a preview is provided in the settings dialog.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Confirmations - by default, the “Erase Markings” and “Delete Fretboard” buttons in fretboards will challenge you before carrying out their action.
                  The challenges are there to prevent accidental erase/deletion. If you would rather Frettly act on the button press without challenge, switch 
                  either or both off here. When one of those buttons has had its challenge switched off in settings, the buttons icon will be coloured orange
                  to remind you of its immediacy.
                </li>
