          <h2>Frettly (the app)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Frettly is designed to work without collecting personal information. Your fretboards/documents are stored locally
  on your Mac (and only sync if you choose to store them in a cloud location such as iCloud Drive via Finder/Files).
</p>

<h3>Data the app collects</h3>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>No personal data is collected by the app.</strong></li>
  <li>The app does not include advertising, third-party analytics, or tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
<p>
  If you purchase Frettly Pro, the transaction is processed by Apple. I do not receive your payment details.
  Apple may associate purchases with your Apple ID according to Apple’s policies.
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>
  If you contact me for support, I will receive your email address and the contents of your message.
  I use that information only to respond and improve Frettly.
</p>

          <h2>frettly.app (this site)</h2>
          <p>
            I do not intentionally collect personal data through this website and I do not run my own analytics.
            However, like most websites, some technical data may be processed to deliver pages reliably and securely.
          </p>

          <h3>Basic technical data</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Your IP address (or a portion of it), browser type, device details, and request metadata may appear in access logs.</li>
            <li>This information is typically used for security, performance, and troubleshooting (for example, protecting the site from abuse).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hosting and delivery providers</h3>
          <p>
            frettly.app is hosted using GitHub Pages and delivered via Cloudflare (DNS/CDN). These providers may process
            technical data (including IP address and request information) when you access the site.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            frettly.app does not intentionally set non-essential cookies for advertising or analytics.
            However, GitHub and/or Cloudflare may set cookies or similar technologies that are strictly necessary
            for site delivery and security.
          </p>

          <h2>Email contact</h2>
          <p>
            If you email me with feedback, feature requests, or support questions, I will receive your email address and
            the contents of your message.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>I use this information only to respond and to improve Frettly.</li>
            <li>I do not sell your email address or message content.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data retention</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Emails are kept only as long as needed to respond and to maintain reasonable support history.</li>
            <li>Website technical logs are retained according to the policies of the hosting/CDN providers (GitHub / Cloudflare).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            I do not share personal data with third parties except where required to operate the site (GitHub Pages and Cloudflare),
            or where required by law.
          </p>

          <h2>Your rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location (for example, under UK GDPR), you may have rights to request access to, correction of,
            or deletion of personal data I hold about you (such as support emails). To make a request, contact:
          </p>
            <span class="email">hello@frettly.app</span>
          <p/>

          <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            I may update this privacy notice from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will reflect
            the most recent change.
