      <h2>Why Go Pro?</h2>
      <p>
        Frettly started life as a personal project to help me understand the guitar through clear visualisation and
        interactive music-theory tools. Frettly Pro is the document-based realisation of that desire, allowing you to save 
        multiple scale/chord/mode fretboards within individual documents, built for players who want to: 
        explore scales, chords and tunings in a way that connects what you see with what you hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you go Pro, you’re getting more than just the current feature set – you’re also supporting ongoing
        development and helping to shape where Frettly goes next.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Get with Frettly Pro</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>All available instrument tunings.</li>
        <li>Access to create fretboards with 14 Scale types, 9 Modes, and 44 Chord types.</li>
        <li>Future enhancements and improvements included at no extra cost.</li>
        <li>A native macOS, document-based experience designed for focused practice.</li>
        <li>Ongoing refinements based on real user feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are no subscriptions and no micro in-app purchases planned – just a straightforward, one-time purchase on the
        Mac App Store.
