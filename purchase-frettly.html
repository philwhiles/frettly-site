  <h1>Purchase Frettly</h1>
<h2>
  Unlock Frettly Pro as a one-time purchase on the Mac App Store and get ongoing updates to existing features —
  bug fixes, performance improvements, and refinements — at no extra cost.
  No monthly or annual subscriptions, just a one-off purchase, with Family Sharing enabled.

<h2>Why Go Pro?</h2>
<p>
  Frettly started life as a personal project to help me understand the guitar through clear visualisation, 
  interactivity and application of music theory. Frettly Pro is the document-based realisation of that desire, allowing you to save
  multiple scale/chord/mode fretboards within individual documents — built for players who want to explore scales,
  chords and tunings with flexible features and interactive audio.
</p>
<p>
  When you go Pro, you’re getting more than just the current feature set — you’re also supporting ongoing
  development and helping to shape where Frettly goes next.
</p>

<h2>What You Get with Frettly Pro</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Access to the full Pro feature set available today.</li>
  <li>All current instrument tunings, plus future tuning additions.</li>
  <li>Create fretboards with the full catalogue of 14 Scale types, 9 Modes, and 44 Chord types — with more added over time.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes, performance improvements, and refinements to existing features.</li>
  <li>Ongoing refinements based on real user feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are no subscriptions — just a straightforward, one-time purchase on the Mac App Store.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, substantial new modules may be available separately. If that happens, they’ll be clearly labelled and
  entirely optional — you’ll always keep what you’ve already unlocked.
