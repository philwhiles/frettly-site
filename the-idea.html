  <h1>Motivation to Build Frettly</h1>
  <h2>
    Frettly is my attempt to build the guitar-learning tool I wish I’d had –
    a way to explore scales, chords and tunings visually, and actually hear what you’re looking at.

      <h2>Why I Built Frettly</h2>
      <p>
        I first started learning guitar five years ago, and wanted to understand more about music theory.
        How are scales and chords constructed? What are the “rules” that determine which notes form a C Major scale –
        or a Dsus4 chord? What determines whether a note in a scale should be shown as 'A#' or 'Bb'?
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a professional software developer with forty years’ experience. I began with
        BASIC, Forth, Pascal and Z80
        at a young age, just as the industry was taking off. I’ve always enjoyed the logic of coding, but also the art
        and craft of designing elegant, maintainable software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forty years ago I turned my hobby into my career and have worked my way through
        C, C++, Java, HTML, Javascript, Golang, Dart and Swift.
      </p>

      <h2>From Frettler to Frettly</h2>
      <p>
        Back to Frettly. When I was learning guitar and trying to understand how music theory applies to the instrument,
        I naturally started writing some Java code to help cement concepts in my head. What began as rough code to
        calculate scales became a program that printed them out in a pseudo-graphical format in the terminal. That meant
        working out where those notes were on the fretboard – in code.
      </p>
      <p>Then the “what ifs” started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What if the tuning were different?</li>
        <li>What if the guitar were left-handed?</li>
        <li>What if the instrument were actually a ukulele?</li>
        <li>And so on…</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ideas kept coming, and the features grew and grew, eventually becoming an open-source Java command-line
        program called
        <a href="https://github.com/philwhiles/frettler" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Frettler
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from Frettly's pre-cursor, Frettler, I got carried away. But it always bugged me that all of that complex
        music-theory logic ended up behind a basic command-line interface. The older Frettler is a one-shot program –
        you run it, it prints the result, and it exits. Rinse, repeat.
      </p>

      <h2>A New Start in Swift</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted the original Frettler to have a proper graphical interface – something interactive and something you could actually
        hear. So I began porting the core music-theory engine from Java to Swift, which was quite a learning exercise.
        Then I paused… for a few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year I returned to design and build <strong>Frettly</strong>, a native macOS document-based application
        that lets you build a portfolio of scales, chords and modes you want to study and practise.
        I now had a better idea as to what Frettlys UI should look like, how I wanted it to function and what would make 
        it super useful for myself and other guitarists (and bassists, and ...).
      </p>

      <h2>Where Frettly Is Going</h2>
      <p>
        As you’ll see from the original Frettler features, I have a backlog of ideas I’d love to build into Frettly – but I want
        user feedback on what would actually be useful, and how you’d like these features to fit into the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t want to bloat Frettly, so I’m taking time to consider how it should evolve. My goal is to help guitarists
        understand the instrument through clear visualisation and interactive theory tools, rather than adding features
        for the sake of it.

      <h2>What Frettly Does Today</h2>
      <p>Frettly will continue to evolve, and allows you to:>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Visualise scales across the fretboard.</li>
        <li>Explore chords and their shapes.</li> 
        <li>Experiment with different tunings.</li>
        <li>Save documents containing collections of scales and chords.</li>
        <li>Hear notes and intervals to connect what you see with what you hear.</li>
      </ul>
