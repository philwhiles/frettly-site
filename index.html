          <h1>Frettly - the interactive fretboard explorer and notebook</h1>

          <h2>
            Frettly is a macOS application dedicated to enabling players of fretted
            instruments to visualise, experiment, and explore scales,
            modes and chords using a document based canvas.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Think of Frettly as Pages, not for text but for fretboards.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Frettly isn't just a scale and chord library - its a persistent, document-based
            workspace designed by a player, for players. Whether you are composing a
            complex jazz piece, teaching a student, or exploring a new tuning on your
            banjo, Frettly organises your theory explorations into easily read, playable, 
            shareable and saveable documents.

            Supporting <b><em>guitar, bass guitar, mandolin, banjo and ukulele</em></b>, each document you create
            can show multiple scales/chords/modes for the document’s chosen instrument, and each
            instrument type supports multiple possible tunings.
          </h2>

            <li>Zoom in and out of fretboards</li>
            <li>Arrange panels using a simple panel management dialog, or by drag-and-drop</li>
            <li>Occurrences of a pattern's note/intervals can be selectively hidden for focussed practise and learning</li>
